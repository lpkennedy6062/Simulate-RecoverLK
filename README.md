This project looks to test a simulate and recover program for the EZ diffusion model. The objective is to determine whether the EZ diffusion model can accurately estimate parameters from data that were generated by the same model. Essentially, this test is used to check consistency in cognitive modeling.
This repository includes a simulation script that generates diffusion model data, a recovery process that estimates the original parameters, and a test script that validates the model's performance. The repository's structure is as followed, with two separate embedded folders, one being the src folder and the other being the test folder. In the src folder there is the code for my forward definition, my inverse definition, my simulate and recover initial script, and a main.sh file that runs simulate and recover. In my test folder I have just two files, one of which is my created tests for simulate and recover and my second is the test.sh file which runs the test-sm file.
The expected results for this test would be having Bias which should average to around 0 across iterations. Also the squared error should decrease as N increases. I would argue that if the EZ diffusion model is accurate and consistent, the recovered parameters should closely match the true parameters. When increasing the sample size, the model should become more accurate when looking at parameter estimation.
Some conclusions that can be gained from this model is more insight into its accuracy, consistency, and limitations. When looking into the consistency of the EZ diffusion model, the bias averaged to 0, meaning that across many simulations, the model didn't overestimate or underestimate the parameters. This means that my model was internally consistent, meaning it can recover its original true parameters. When looking at the data's sample size, as it increases the squared error decreases, confirming the idea that larger datasets increase reliability and decrease noise. While this model is somewhat complex, it is still a simplified version of full diffusion models which are able to account for more variables like trial-by-trial variability and utilize a starting point bias. These full models are able to be more generalized and precise, leading to more accurate data and more confidence in results.
Overall, the EZ diffusion model is an influential tool for estimating parameters from observed summary statistics. This test helps to prove the claim that if data really is created by this model then the estimation procedure will be able to reliably recover that data.
